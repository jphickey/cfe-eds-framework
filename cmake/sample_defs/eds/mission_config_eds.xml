       \par Limits
            All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition

       \par Description:
            Defines the size of the shell command tlm packet segments.The shell command
            output size is dependant on the shell command itself. If the shell output
            size is greater than the size of the packet defined here, the fsw will
            generate a series of tlm packets (of the size defined here) that can be
            reconstructed by the ground system.

       \par Description:
            The value of this constant dictates the max number of mempool blocks within SB messages.
            This represents the definition for Software Bus Messages only and is _NOT_ necessarily
            correlated to the corresponding CFE configuration paramter, which can vary from CPU to CPU.
     
       \par Limits
            This parameter should be equal to the largest CFE_ES_MAX_MEMPOOL_BLOCK_SIZES definition
            in use among all CPUs included within the mission.

       \cfemissioncfg cFE Maximum length for filenames in messages
     
       \par Description:
            The value of this constant dictates the size of filenames within SB messages.
            This is typically the same as OS_MAX_PATH_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
            and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
            across multiple processors.  Since this defines a message format, it must be
            consistent across ALL processors exchanging SB messages.
     
            This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
            time behavior or internal allocation.
        
       \par Limits
            All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition

            The value of this constant dictates the size of API names within SB messages.
            This is typically the same as OS_MAX_API_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
            and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
            across multiple processors.

            Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
            to exceed the max length.
